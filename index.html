            <p>The solar system is a collection of celestial objects bound by gravity to a central star, the Sun.
            </p>
            <p>The solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial
                objects bound by gravity, all orbiting around the Sun.</p>
            <p>The discovery of the solar system as we understand it today evolved over centuries, with key
                contributions from early astronomers.</p>
            <p>The first major breakthrough came from Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century, who proposed the
                heliocentric model, suggesting that the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun,
                challenging the earlier geocentric model (Earth-centered) by Ptolemy. Later, Johannes Kepler and
                Galileo Galilei provided further evidence supporting this model through observations and
                mathematical laws, solidifying the concept of the solar system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sun: A medium-sized star at the center of the solar system, providing the necessary light
                    and heat to sustain life on Earth.</li>
                <li>Planets: Eight major planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths.</li>
                <li>Dwarf Planets: Smaller celestial bodies, such as Pluto, that orbit the Sun but do not clear
                    their orbit of other debris.</li>
                <li>Moons: Many planets have moons (natural satellites) orbiting them. For example, Earth has one
                    moon, while Jupiter has over 80.</li>
                <li>Asteroids: Mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, asteroids are small rocky
                    bodies that also orbit the Sun.</li>
                <li>Comets: Icy bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system. When they approach
                    the Sun, they develop glowing tails due to the heat.</li>
                <li>The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud: Regions beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies and comets.</li>
